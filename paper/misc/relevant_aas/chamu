HIVP
----
The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease is a homodimer that
presents a cavity with an aperture involving low-frequency breathing motions in
which participate synchronized movements of rigid backbone segments[53],[54].
The active site is symmetrically formed by both monomers. The access to the
active site is controlled by two β-turn flaps with specific anchoring regions.
HIV-1 protease can be divided into three domains: the core domain, localized at
the interface containing the active site, the terminal domain including both N
and C terminals, and the flap domain, the most flexible domain[55],[56],[57]
with the two β-turn that acts as gate. 
-
As it is expected, the ΔVol in cartesian coordinates highlights the residues in
the flap domain; many other residues in the core domain also show up. When it
comes to affect the cavity volume, the key residues in the bound protein are
not exactly those that become relevant in the apo-protein. In the bound
protein, the key residues on each monomer are almost exactly mirrored,
suggesting very similar dynamics between each monomer. This is not the case
with the apo-protein, where key residues have a higher variance between
monomers and the most relevants are found in A monomer. Furthermore, while
modes 1, 2 and 4 appear to be the most relevant modes in cavity dynamics, modes
2 and 4 have the higher incidence and they both mostly focus in the A monomer.
This suggests dissimilar dynamics between the monomers, something which is not
evident from analyzing the structure nor the residues absolute displacements.
This freedom that monomers have to move asymmetrically is lost when the protein
binds its ligand.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase presents a main active site
pocket limited by an N-terminal and C-terminal lobes (N and C lobes) that are
connected by a hinge region[58]. While the N lobe is composed of five β-strands
and the αC helix, the C lobe is predominantly helical containing a highly
flexible activation loop. Two main conformations, so-called active and inactive
conformers[59],[60] have been largely structural described and their relative
stabilities have been associated to different types of cancers[61],[62]. 
-

Key residues in the EGFR are scattered across the N lobe, located mainly in the
β-strands and the αC-helix with their side-chains pointing into the cavity. It
has been noted before that the active monomer of the EGFR is unstable and will
transition to the inactive conformation by separation of the lobes, local
unfolding in the hinge region and finally, closing of the lobes[SHAW]. It would seem
that the first step in this process is a costly one, since it involves
spreading the lobes which should imply losing important stabilizing contacts.
Despite this, the transition seems to be spontaneous and is captured by the
first mode, which opens/closes the lobes. Surprisingly, this mode does not
greatly affect cavity volume and is not as relevant as higher frequency modes
are; a fact that shows in Fig. 5, where the EGFR cavity appears in the rigid
end of the spectrum. It appears that side-chaing reordering helps to preserve
contacts and facilitate the transition.

T4L
---
T4 lysozyme (T4L) has been largely studied by either
experimental[63],[64],[65], [66], [67] and theoretical
techniques[68],[69],[70],[71],[72]. The volume of the catalytic clef is
functional significant since opening and closure of the clef is associated to
ligand-binding[73]. Previous PCA studies [68],[73] shows that its firsts PCA
modes are associated to N-terminal and C-terminal inter-domains motions:
hinge-bending, twisting, and relative torsions. These motions have a
substantial impact on the size and shape of the cavity. 
-

As it has been noted before, low-frequency hinge-bending and torsional modes
are the most relevant modes affecting the volume of the cavity. This amounts to
a flexible cavity dominated by a few modes
